# Offchain Labs acquires ZeroDev

::authors

Today we are excited to share that ZeroDev has been acquired by [Offchain Labs](https://www.offchainlabs.com/), the creator of Arbitrum.

## The history of ZeroDev

ZeroDev was founded in 2022 to bring account abstraction to Ethereum.  We played a major role in bringing ERC-4337 into production, culminating in the launch of ZeroDev at ETHDenver 2023, which made us the very first AA solution to go live on Ethereum mainnet.

Since then, ZeroDev has pioneered many of the smart account technologies that people take for granted today, such as modular smart accounts, session keys, chain-abstracted accounts, and more.

Today, ZeroDev powers more than 5 million smart accounts across EVM chains.  Our customers include some of the most successful projects in Web3, such as Infinex, DeFi.app, DIMO, Crossmint, Yellow, Rodeo, and more.

## The road to acquisition

As the wallet ecosystem matured, it became clear to us that account abstraction is no longer the bottleneck for Web3 adoption.  Rather, we should view Web3 UX holistically: it's not just about the account, but also the wallet UI, the bridges, the on/offramps, and even the chains themselves.  Therefore, we faced a choice: should we expand our product suite as an independent team, or join a larger team that shares the same vision with us?

ZeroDev is blessed to have received many acquisition inquiries over the years, but we've always decided to continue building as an independent team.  However, that changed when we connected with Offchain Labs (OCL) earlier this year.  The team at OCL not only shares with us the same vision of tackling Web3 UX through a single unifying stack, but they also possess the R&D ability to actually bring this ambitious vision to life, as evident from Arbitrum, Orbit, Stylus, Prysm, and other amazing projects OCL has developed.

Therefore, we are incredibly excited to be joining forces with Offchain Labs.  With the help of OCL, we will bring ZeroDev to new heights and provide you with the best developer solutions for building amazing Web3 experiences.

## FAQs

Here we address some questions that our customers are likely to have:

### What does it mean for ZeroDev users?

Expect everything to get better.  We are integrating with OCL across all functions such as engineering, support, SRE, marketing, etc., so you can expect not just more features but also better support, higher uptime, more tweets, etc.

### Will this affect the product?

Yes -- but only positively.  ZeroDev will expand its product suite under the OCL umbrella, offering not just smart accounts but other technologies for developers to build a compelling Web3 experience.

### Does it mean ZeroDev will only support Arbitrum?

Of course not!  While we love Arbitrum, we understand that a wallet product is only valuable if it supports as many chains as possible.  ZeroDev already supports 50+ chains today and will continue to expand to more chains, only at a faster pace.

### What new features are coming to ZeroDev?

Stay tuned!  The rest of 2025 is going to be a wild ride.
