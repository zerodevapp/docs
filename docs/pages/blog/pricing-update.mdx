# Scaling the Future of Account Abstraction: Introducing ZeroDev Credits

::authors

We have an exciting update to share about how ZeroDev is evolving to support the next generation of our platform!

For our existing customers on paid plans, let us be perfectly clear: **if you are a current customer, your current pricing and included usage are NOT changing. You will be billed according to the new system, but your pricing will stay the same.** This update is a seamless transition to a unified measurement system, ensuring you continue to get the same great value as we grow.

At ZeroDev, we believe in building infrastructure that doesn't just solve today's problems but anticipates tomorrow's growth. As our platform expands, we need a system as elegant and unified as the solutions we provide.

Today, we're excited to introduce ZeroDev Credits, a unified pricing framework designed to simplify your experience and unlock the next stage of our platform.

### The Big Picture: Why Credits?

The shift from measuring usage in User Operations ("UserOps") to "Credits" is about more than just a name change. It’s a strategic move to create a single, consistent framework for all products.

Instead of introducing separate, confusing pricing models for our features, everything now draws from a single pool of Credits. This keeps your billing clear, predictable, and fully aligned with ZeroDev’s commitment to simplicity.

### New ZeroDev Plan Details

Our new plans are designed to scale with your ambition, focusing on the _value_ unlocked at each level.

The new pricing will go live on **December 1st**.

### **Important Note on Overage Rates**

The table above focuses on included value, but we also ensure predictable scaling:

*   **Credit Overage Rate:** For Growth and Scale plans, overages will be priced at: 
    
    *   Growth: $0.0020 per credit ($0.04 per UserOp)
        
    *   Scale: $0.0010 per credit ($0.02 per UserOp)
        

Please [contact our Sales team](https://calendly.com/zerodev/30min) for Enterprise overage costs.

### How ZeroDev Credits Work

Credits are consumed by the actions you take on the platform. This model accounts for the compute and infrastructure costs of that specific action, providing transparent pricing whether you're using our products, now and in the future.

| Action | Credit Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Send UserOp | 20 credits | Using your own signer, bundled by ZeroDev. |

### What This Means for Existing Customers  

We want this transition to be seamless, and above all, beneficial.

**Your current pricing and included usage are NOT changing.**

*   You will retain your existing limits and pricing for all products and services you are currently using.
    
*   We are simply translating your existing UserOp usage and overage rates into the new Credit system.
    
*   **No action is required from you.** Your account will automatically transition to reflect usage in Credits. _Please note: Usage tracking will continue to be visible in UserOps on the Statistics page for historical continuity._
    

This update is a testament to our growth — and as an existing user, you’re already part of that journey.
