# The Performance Leap: ZeroDev Unlocks Go-Native Account Abstraction for Mission-Critical Web3 Scale.

::authors

The **long-awaited native Account Abstraction solution** for mission-critical, Go-powered infrastructure is finally here.

For decades, **Go** has been the uncompromised backbone of high-performance, concurrent, and scalable enterprise infrastructure. Today, that unmatched performance and reliability arrive in web3. Elite engineering teams have long been forced to work around a developer tool ecosystem that has exclusively focused on TypeScript and JavaScript, creating a crippling bottleneck for Go-powered systems.

ZeroDev changes the game.

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the **ZeroDev Go SDK** and a dedicated, new **User Operation Builder API**. This launch makes ZeroDev the first smart account provider to offer native, high-integrity support for sending **UserOps** directly from a **Go backend**. This is more than just a library. This is a massive, performance-driven opportunity for enterprise clients to deploy sophisticated, gasless, and batched transaction experiences at **Go speed** within their existing infrastructure.

### The Go-Native AA Powerhouse: Reliability Through Dual Architecture

We’ve engineered a new, two-part architecture designed specifically for backend scale, reliability, and EIP-4337/7702 compliance.

* **ZeroDev Go SDK:** A lightweight, idiomatic Go library for secure UserOp creation, signing, and lifecycle management. It feels like Go, because it is Go.
* **UserOp Builder API (The Resilience Layer):** A dedicated, resilient, and dockerized backend service that handles the heavy lifting of UserOp construction, gas estimation, and the complexities of the EIP-4337/7702 standards. This offloads all mission-critical AA infrastructure complexity from your core application.

The `/build-userop` API is now live and accessible at: <https://build-userop-api.zerodev.app>. The Go SDK source code can be found on GitHub: <https://github.com/zerodevapp/go-sdk>.

### The Strategic Impact: Why Go-Native AA Matters for Your Business 💡

For CTOs and VPs of Engineering, this launch provides a clear competitive advantage by eliminating the last engineering trade-off in web3 integration.

* **Maximum Uptime & Reliability:** Offload the complexity of EIP-4337/7702 standards to a dedicated, resilient, and optionally self-hostable backend service.
* **Unmatched Transaction Throughput:** Leverage **Go's native concurrency** to process UserOps with significantly lower latency and higher transaction volume than comparable non-Go solutions.
* **De-Risking the Roadmap:** The solution is built on a Standards-First principle, ensuring your backend is **EIP-7702 Native** and future-proofed for the next generation of smart accounts.
* **Superior User Experience:** Seamlessly deliver features like **Gas Sponsorship Integration** and **batching** multiple complex blockchain calls into a single, atomic UserOp.

### Code Meets Scale: Sending Your First Go UserOp

Integrating the SDK is straightforward, letting your developers start building a scalable backend in minutes.

First, install the SDK using Go modules:

```bash
go get [github.com/zerodevapp/sdk-go](https://github.com/zerodevapp/sdk-go)
```
Here is an illustrative, streamlined example of how the SDK enables you to leverage ZeroDev's hosted API to build and send an EIP-7782 UserOp:

```Go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "github.com/zerodevapp/sdk-go"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Initialize the ZeroDev Client
    baseURL := "https://build-userop-api.zerodev.app"
    projectID := "YOUR_PROJECT_ID" // From ZeroDev Dashboard
    privateKey := "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY" // Signing key for the smart account

    client, err := zerodev.NewClient(baseURL, projectID, privateKey)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // 2. Define the transaction call(s)
    call := zerodev.Call{
        To:   "0xTargetContractAddress",
        Data: []byte{ /* encoded transaction data */ },
        Value: 0,
    }

    // 3. Build and Send the UserOp
    userOpHash, err := client.SendUserOperation(context.Background(), []zerodev.Call{call})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("UserOperation sent! Hash: %s\n", userOpHash)

    // 4. Poll for the receipt for guaranteed transaction finality
    receipt, err := client.WaitForUserOperationReceipt(context.Background(), userOpHash)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("UserOperation executed in transaction: %s\n", receipt.TransactionHash)
}
```

## The ZeroDev Enterprise Advantage: Performance is Exclusive

The ZeroDev Go SDK and hosted UserOp Builder API are powerful, mission-critical tools exclusively available for users on a **ZeroDev Enterprise plan**.

This exclusivity ensures our highest-volume clients receive the dedicated performance, throughput, and tier-1 support needed for the most demanding applications. For organizations requiring absolute data control, flexibility, and maximum concurrency, the User Operation Builder API is also accessible for **self-hosting via Docker**.

**Your Path to Mission-Critical Infrastructure Starts Now.**

Don't just integrate AA — deploy it at Go-speed and enterprise scale.
