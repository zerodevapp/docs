## The Performance Leap: ZeroDev Unlocks Go-Native Account Abstraction for Mission-Critical Web3 Scale

The **long-awaited native Account Abstraction solution** for mission-critical, Go-powered infrastructure is finally here.

For decades, **Go** has been the uncompromised backbone of high-performance, concurrent, and scalable enterprise infrastructure. Today, that unmatched performance and reliability arrive in web3. Elite engineering teams have long been forced to work around a developer tool ecosystem that has exclusively focused on TypeScript and JavaScript, creating a crippling bottleneck for Go-powered systems.

ZeroDev changes the game.

We are thrilled to announce the launch of the **ZeroDev Go SDK** and a dedicated, new **User Operation Builder API**. This launch makes ZeroDev the first smart account provider to offer native, high-integrity support for sending **UserOps** directly from a **Go backend**. This is more than just a library. This is a massive, performance-driven opportunity for enterprise clients to deploy sophisticated, gasless, and batched transaction experiences at **Go speed** within their existing infrastructure.

### The Go-Native AA Powerhouse: Reliability Through Dual Architecture

We’ve engineered a new, two-part architecture designed specifically for backend scale, reliability, and EIP-4337/7702 compliance.

* **ZeroDev Go SDK:** A lightweight, idiomatic Go library for secure UserOp creation, signing, and lifecycle management. It feels like Go, because it is Go.
* **UserOp Builder API (The Resilience Layer):** A dedicated, resilient, and dockerized backend service that handles the heavy lifting of UserOp construction, gas estimation, and the complexities of the EIP-4337/7702 standards. This offloads all mission-critical AA infrastructure complexity from your core application.

The `/build-userop` API is now live and accessible at: [https://build-userop-api.zerodev.app](https://build-userop-api.zerodev.app). The Go SDK source code can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/zerodevapp/go-sdk](https://github.com/zerodevapp/go-sdk).

### The Strategic Impact: Why Go-Native AA Matters for Your Business 💡

For CTOs and VPs of Engineering, this launch provides a clear competitive advantage by eliminating the last engineering trade-off in web3 integration.

* **Maximum Uptime & Reliability:** Offload the complexity of EIP-4337/7702 standards to a dedicated, resilient, and optionally self-hostable backend service.
* **Unmatched Transaction Throughput:** Leverage **Go's native concurrency** to process UserOps with significantly lower latency and higher transaction volume than comparable non-Go solutions.
* **De-Risking the Roadmap:** The solution is built on a Standards-First principle, ensuring your backend is **EIP-7702 Native** and future-proofed for the next generation of smart accounts.
* **Superior User Experience:** Seamlessly deliver features like **Gas Sponsorship Integration** and **batching** multiple complex blockchain calls into a single, atomic UserOp.

### Code Meets Scale: Sending Your First Go UserOp

Integrating the SDK is straightforward, letting your developers start building a scalable backend in minutes.

First, install the SDK using Go modules:

```bash
go get [github.com/zerodevapp/sdk-go](https://github.com/zerodevapp/sdk-go)
