# 1-click Trading

Yi supports "permissions" through through ERC-7702, a standard coauthored by ZeroDev, WalletConnect, MetaMask, Coinbase, and Biconomy.  A Yi user can grant permissions to the DApp to execute specific transactions on their behalf.  For example, the user might say:

- When I use this app, it can trade up to 1000 USDC on Uniswap for me.

Once the DApp has received these permissions, it can now send transactions on behalf of the user without further confirmation prompts, so long as the transactions are within the permissions. Therefore, the user gains a "1-click trading" experience without sacrificing security.

## Requesting permissions

To request permissions, use Viem's `grantPermissions` API:

```tsx
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains'
import { erc7715Actions } from 'viem/experimental'
import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'

function App() {
  // Get wallet client from Yi
  const client = useWalletClient()

  // Extend the wallet client with 7715 actions
  const permissionsClient = client.extend(erc7715Actions()) 
  
  // Request permissions
  const permissionsContext = await permissionsClient.grantPermissions({/* ... */})

  // ...the rest of your code
}
 
```

For example, to request permissions to spend up to some amount of ERC20 tokens from a specific set of contracts:

```tsx
const permissionsContext = await permissionsClient.grantPermissions({ 
  permissions: [
    {
      type: { custom: "erc20-token-approve" },
      data: {
        tokenAddress,
        allowance,
        contractAllowList: [
          {
            address: erc20SpenderAddress,
            functions: [
              toFunctionSelector(
                getAbiItem({
                  abi: erc20SpenderAbi,
                  name: "spendAllowance",
                })
              ),
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      policies: [],
    },
  ]
})
```

## Executing transactions with permissions

Once you have obtained a `permissionsContext`, you can execute transactions with the permissions with [`sendCalls()`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendCalls) or [`writeContracts()`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContracts), by including the `permissionsContext` as a capability.  For example, using `writeContracts()`:


```tsx
import { parseAbi } from 'viem'
import { writeContracts } from '@wagmi/core/experimental'
import { config } from './config'

const abi = parseAbi([
  'function spendAllowance1(address, uint256) returns (bool)',
  'function spendAllowance2(address, address, uint256) returns (bool)',
])

const id = await writeContracts(config, {
  contracts: [
    {
      address: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
      abi,
      functionName: 'spendAllowance1',
      args: [
        '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC', 
        100n
      ],
    },
    {
      address: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
      abi,
      functionName: 'spendAllowance2',
      args: [
        '0xa5cc3c03994DB5b0d9A5eEdD10CabaB0813678AC',
        '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
        100n
      ],
    },
  ],
  capabilities: { 
    permissions: { 
      context: '<permissionsContext>'
    } 
  },
})
```
