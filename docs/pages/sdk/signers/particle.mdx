# Use Particle Network with ZeroDev

[Particle Network](https://particle.network) provides Wallet Abstraction services that make user onboarding easier.

Using the [Particle Auth SDK](https://developers.particle.network/api-reference/auth/desktop-sdks/web), you can enable quick, 2-click onboarding through social logins. Users can sign up with familiar Web2 options like Google, email, or phone numbers. Particle ensures both security and convenience by employing MPC-TSS for secure key management.

Integrating ZeroDev with Particle Auth enables a seamless social login experience through Particle, while leveraging ZeroDev as the smart wallet to handle gas fee sponsorship, transaction batching, and additional advanced features.

## Set up

To integrate Particle Network with ZeroDev, start by creating a Particle Auth application:

1. Refer to the [Particle Quickstart guide](https://developers.particle.network/guides/wallet-as-a-service/waas/auth/web-quickstart) to quickly set up a Particle Auth project.

## Integration

Integrating ZeroDev with Particle Auth is straightforward after setting up the project. Particle Auth provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the Particle Network object

Once your Particle Auth project is set up, you will have access to a `provider` object through the `useEthereum()` hook, as shown below. 

```typescript
import { useEthereum } from "@particle-network/authkit";

// Inside your component or app function
const { provider } = useEthereum();
```

### Use with ZeroDev

Use the `provider` from Particle Network to create a smart account signer, which can be passed to a validator. For detailed guidance on using a validator, refer to our documentation on [creating accounts](/sdk/core-api/create-account#api).

```typescript
import { signerToEcdsaValidator } from "@zerodev/ecdsa-validator"
import { KERNEL_V3_1 } from "@zerodev/sdk/constants"
import { providerToSmartAccountSigner, ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07 } from 'permissionless';
import { createPublicClient } from "viem";
import { polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains';

// Convert the Particle provider to a SmartAccountSigner
const smartAccountSigner = await providerToSmartAccountSigner(provider);

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  transport: http('https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology'),
  chain: polygonAmoy,
})

// Pass your `smartAccountSigner` to the validator
const ecdsaValidator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: smartAccountSigner,
  entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V07,
  kernelVersion: KERNEL_V3_1
})

// You can now use this ECDSA Validator to create a Kernel account
```
