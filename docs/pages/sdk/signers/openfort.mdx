# Use Openfort with ZeroDev

[Openfort](https://www.openfort.io/) is a wallet infrastructure platform that provides embedded wallets with built-in account abstraction support. It offers passkey authentication, social login, and seamless onboarding experiences for both web and mobile applications. Openfort's embedded wallets are non-custodial by design and support ERC-4337 smart accounts with features like gas sponsorship, transaction batching, and session keys.

## Set up

To use Openfort with ZeroDev, first create an application that integrates with Openfort.

- Refer to the [Openfort documentation site](https://www.openfort.io/docs) for instructions on setting up an application.
- For a quick start, Openfort provides a demo application, available [here](https://demo.openfort.io/).

## Integration

Integrating ZeroDev with Openfort is straightforward after setting up your project. Openfort provides an EIP-1193 compatible provider that can be used as a signer with Kernel.

### Create the Openfort client and get the provider

After following the Openfort documentation, you will have access to an Openfort client. Here's how to set it up:

```typescript
import { Openfort } from '@openfort/openfort-js'

// Initialize Openfort with your keys
const openfort = new Openfort({
  baseConfiguration: {
    publishableKey: "YOUR_OPENFORT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  },
  shieldConfiguration: {
    shieldPublishableKey: "YOUR_SHIELD_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  }
})

// Authenticate the user (e.g., with email, social login, or passkeys)
// See Openfort docs for authentication options

// Get the EIP-1193 provider
const openfortProvider = await openfort.embeddedWallet.getEthereumProvider()
```

### Use with ZeroDev

Use the provider from Openfort to create a smart account signer, which can be passed to a validator. For detailed guidance on using a validator, refer to our documentation on [creating accounts](/sdk/core-api/create-account#api).

```typescript
import { signerToEcdsaValidator } from "@zerodev/ecdsa-validator"
import { KERNEL_V3_1, getEntryPoint } from "@zerodev/sdk/constants"
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem"
import { polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains'

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  // Use your own RPC provider (e.g. Infura/Alchemy).
  transport: http('https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology'),
  chain: polygonAmoy,
})

// Pass your Openfort provider to the validator
const ecdsaValidator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: openfortProvider,
  entryPoint: getEntryPoint("0.7"),
  kernelVersion: KERNEL_V3_1
})

// You can now use this ECDSA Validator to create a Kernel account
```

### Using with Viem

Openfort's provider is also compatible with Viem's `createWalletClient`:

```typescript
import { createWalletClient, custom } from 'viem'
import { polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains'

// Create a wallet client from the Openfort provider
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: polygonAmoy,
  transport: custom(openfortProvider)
})

// Use the wallet client with ZeroDev
const ecdsaValidator = await signerToEcdsaValidator(publicClient, {
  signer: walletClient,
  entryPoint: getEntryPoint("0.7"),
  kernelVersion: KERNEL_V3_1
})
```

## React Integration

If you're using React, Openfort provides hooks for easier integration:

```typescript
import { useOpenfort } from '@openfort/openfort-react'

function App() {
  const { embeddedWallet, user } = useOpenfort()

  const getProvider = async () => {
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error("User not authenticated")
    }
    return await embeddedWallet.getEthereumProvider()
  }

  // Use the provider with ZeroDev as shown above
}
```
