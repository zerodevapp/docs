# Rate Limit Policy

The rate limit policy specifies the frequency at which the signer is allowed to send UserOps.

## API

```ts
import { toRateLimitPolicy } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

// In this example, the signer can send one UserOp per month
const rateLimitPolicy = toRateLimitPolicy({
  count: 1,
  interval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  // one month in seconds
})

const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    rateLimitPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

Arguments to `toRateLimitPolicy`:

- `count`: the number of times the signer can send UserOps in the given internal.
- (optional) `interval`: the length of the interval, in seconds.
  - If not specified, then the interval is infinite, which means that you can use `count` to specify the number of times the signer can send UserOps in total.
- (optional) `startAt`: the starting UNIX timestamp for when the rate limit should take effect.  Before that, the signer cannot send any UserOps.

# Rate Limit Policy with reset

## API

```ts
import { toRateLimitPolicy, RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

// In this example, the signer can send one UserOp per month
const rateLimitPolicy = toRateLimitPolicy({
  count: 1,
  interval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  // one month in seconds
})

const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  policyAddress : RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT,
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    rateLimitPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

## Comparison with Rate Limit Policy without reset

- With reset
  - userOps can be called up to `count` times within a given `interval`.
  - The amount of available userOps resets when the current `interval` expires (meaning you get `count` uses again).

- Without reset
  - userOps can be called a total of `count` times, and the available amount only decreases with use (no reset over time).
  - Each userOps call must have at least an `interval` of time between it and the next call.

### example

if you want to set recurring payment logic for every month without reset and expect to live for next 2 years, paramters will be

```
  count : 24,
  interval : 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // 30 days for month
  startAt : <Current timestamp in UNIX timestamp format>
```

if you want to set it with reset, parameters will be

```
  count : 1,
  interval : 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // 30 days for month
  startAt : 0 or undefined
```

## Notice

Although RateLimitWithReset is powerful, it violates erc4337 opcode rule to access `block.timestamp` this will only work with bundlers that accepts this opcode
