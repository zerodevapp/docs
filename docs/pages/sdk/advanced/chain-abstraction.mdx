# Chain abstraction

ZeroDev is the first smart account solution to support *cross-chain transactions,* also sometimes known as "chain abstraction."

More specifically, a ZeroDev smart account can use its tokens from one chain on another chain, without bridging.  Some examples are:

- Stake ETH on Ethereum mainnet using ETH on Polygon.
- Spend USDC on Base to purchase an NFT sold in USDT on Arbitrum.
- Execute a transaction on Blast by paying gas in DAI from Optimism.

## Features

### Compatible with EIP-7702

Unlike other chain abstraction solutions, ZeroDev Chain Abstraction supports not just regular smart accounts (ERC-4337), but also smart EOAs (EIP-7702).

### Cross-chain without bridging

Don't ask your users to visit a bridge.  With ZeroDev, your users can make cross-chain transactions just like how they make normal transactions, without ever leaving your app.

### Unparalleled speed

Cross-chain transactions with ZeroDev are very fast, thanks to *intents* -- solvers compete on the destination chain to fill your intents as quickly as possible.

### Deep liquidity

Most "chain abstraction" solutions on the market are toys that fail under any real amount of traffic.  ZeroDev's cross-chain transactions network is built on top of protocols with the deepest liquidity, such as Relay and Across.

## Code example

Here is a [complete code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/intent/main.ts) for using CAB.  You can run the example by cloning the repo.

## Setting up chain abstraction

:::info
We highly recommend that you use the code example above as a reference as you follow this guide.
:::

### Installation

Chain abstraction is implemented with the `@zerodev/intent` package:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @zerodev/intent @zerodev/sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zerodev/intent @zerodev/sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @zerodev/intent @zerodev/sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @zerodev/intent @zerodev/sdk
```

:::

### Choosing a validator

While chain abstraction works with any validator, we highly recommend using a multi-chain validator like `@zerodev/multi-chain-ecdsa-validator` for new projects. Multi-chain validators are optimized for cross-chain transactions because they can sign for multiple input chains with a single signature, making the process more efficient.

If you're starting a new project, you can install the multi-chain ECDSA validator:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @zerodev/multi-chain-ecdsa-validator
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zerodev/multi-chain-ecdsa-validator
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @zerodev/multi-chain-ecdsa-validator
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @zerodev/multi-chain-ecdsa-validator
```

:::

### Setting up the Kernel account

First, make sure you know how to [create ZeroDev accounts](/sdk/core-api/create-account).

The flow for creating a chain-abstracted ZeroDev account is the same, with the following exceptions:

- For your `kernelVersion`, make sure to use `KERNEL_V3_2` or above.

```ts
const kernelVersion = KERNEL_V3_2;
```

- When setting up the `kernelAccount`, set up the `initConfig` to install the intent executor:

```ts
import { installIntentExecutor, INTENT_V0_4 } from '@zerodev/intent'

const kernelAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
  },
  kernelVersion,
  entryPoint,
  initConfig: [installIntentExecutor(INTENT_V0_4)]
})
```

- Instead of using the normal `createKernelAccountClient`, use `createIntentClient` instead:

```ts
const intentClient = createIntentClient({
  chain,
  account: kernelAccount,
  bundlerTransport: http(bundlerRpc),
  version: INTENT_V0_4
})
```

## Using chain abstraction

At the core of chain abstraction is the idea of a "chain-abstracted balance" (CAB), which is a unified balance across all the chains.  For example, if you have 100 USDC on Base and 200 on Arbitrum, then you have 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" which you can spend on any chain.

### Getting Chain-abstracted Balances

To get your account's chain abstracted balances, use `getCAB`:


```ts
const cab = await intentClient.getCAB({
  // Specify any networks you want to aggregate.
  // If you skip this flag, it will aggregate from all the networks we support, but it may be slower.
  networks: [arbitrum.id, base.id],

  // Specify the tokens you want to aggregate balances for.
  // If you skip this flag, it will return all the tokens we support, but it may be slower.
  tokenTickers: ["USDC", "WETH"],
})
```

This will return not just the unified balance, but also the breakdown of the balance across chains, so that you know on which chains you actually have the tokens.

### Spending chain-abstracted balance

To spend your CAB on a transaction, use `sendUserIntent`:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  // Execute any number of calls in a batch
  calls: [
    {
      to: ...,
      value: ...,
      data: ...,
    },
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: base.id,
      address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on base
      amount: parseUnits('1000', 6), // 1000 USDC
    },
  ],
})

// Wait for the intent to be executed on the destination chain
const receipt = await intentClient.waitForUserIntentExecutionReceipt({
  uiHash: result.outputUiHash.uiHash,
});
console.log(`Intent executed on chain: ${receipt?.executionChainId}`);
```

Here:

- `calls` is a [batch](/sdk/core-api/batch-transactions) of calls to execute atomically.
- `outputTokens` is the chain-abstracted token that your calls require.  For example, if your calls are looking to spend 500 USDC to buy an NFT, then you'd specify 500 USDC with the `outputTokens`.
  - If you want to use ETH as the output token, set the address to `zeroAddress`.

Note that in this example, it doesn't matter whether you actually have USDC on Base.  So long as you have enough USDC across all the chains, the transaction will execute.

### Specifying input tokens

By default, when you spend CAB, the SDK uses tokens from chains with the highest balance. If you need more fine-grained control, you can manually specify the input tokens with `inputTokens`, which makes the API look like this:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  calls: [
    // execute any number of calls in an atomic batch
  ],
  inputTokens: [
    // tokens from source chains
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    // tokens for the target chain
  ],
})
```

Here's a real example for using USDC on Arbitrum to execute a transaction on Base:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  // Execute any number of calls in a batch
  calls: [
    {
      to: ...,
      value: ...,
      data: ...,
    },
  ],
  inputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: arbitrum.id,
      address: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on arb
    },
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: base.id,
      address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on base
      amount: parseUnits('1000', 6), // 1000 USDC
    },
  ],
})
```

Note that you do NOT need to specify an amount for your `inputTokens`.  Your input token amount is estimated from your output token amount, plus gas (assuming you want to pay gas with the input tokens -- see below).

### Gas configurations

When using intents, you may use the `gasToken` flag to configure how to pay gas.

- By default (with no `gasToken` specified), gas is paid in CAB (input tokens) itself.
- If you specify `gasToken: 'NATIVE'`, the account will pay gas with the native token (e.g. ETH).
- If you specify `gasToken: 'SPONSORED'`, you will be [sponsoring gas](/sdk/core-api/sponsor-gas) for the account.
- If you specify `gasToken: 'USDC'` or `gasToken: 'USDT'`, you will pay gas with the specified stablecoin.

### Parallel intent execution

:::info
Parallel intent execution requires `INTENT_V0_4` or above.
:::

ZeroDev supports executing multiple intents simultaneously, enabling you to batch multiple cross-chain transactions in parallel. This is particularly useful when you need to execute several independent transactions at the same time.

To execute intents in parallel, you'll need to use different nonce keys for each intent:

```ts
import { getCustomNonceKeyFromString } from '@zerodev/intent'

const sendIntent = async (nonceKey: bigint) => {
  // send intent
  const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
    calls: [
      {
        to: zeroAddress,
        value: BigInt(0),
        data: '0x',
      },
    ],
    chainId: chain.id,
    nonceKey,
  });
}

const nonceKey = getCustomNonceKeyFromString('nonce');
const nonceKey2 = getCustomNonceKeyFromString('nonce2');

// send intents in parallel
await Promise.all([sendIntent(nonceKey), sendIntent(nonceKey2)]);
```

### Waiting for intents to resolve

Cross-chain transactions happen in multiple steps: first opening on the input chains (where your tokens come from), then executing on the destination chain. The `sendUserIntent` function returns hash identifiers that let you track both steps:

```ts
// Send the intent
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  // ... your intent configuration ...
});


// Wait for the intent to be opened on all input chains
// NOTE: if you just want to wait for the intent to fully resolve, you don't need to wait
// for the input intents.  Just wait for the execution intent.
await Promise.all(
  result.inputsUiHash.map(async (data) => {
    const openReceipts = await intentClient.waitForUserIntentOpenReceipt({
      uiHash: data.uiHash,
    });
    console.log(
      `Intent opened on chain ${openReceipts?.openChainId} with transaction hash: ${openReceipts?.receipt.transactionHash}`
    );
  })
);

// Wait for final execution on the destination chain
const receipt = await intentClient.waitForUserIntentExecutionReceipt({
  uiHash: result.outputUiHash.uiHash,
});
console.log(
  `Intent executed on chain: ${receipt?.executionChainId} with transaction hash: ${receipt?.receipt.transactionHash}`
);
```

This tracking system ensures you have complete visibility into your cross-chain transaction's progress, from initiation through to final execution.  If you simply want to wait until the intent fully resolves, just waiting for the execution receipt is enough.

## Supported tokens and networks

Feel free to reach out to us with the link on top of this page if you want to see more tokens or networks supported.

### Mainnet

We support **USDC, USDT, WETH, and ETH** for cross-chain transactions, on the following networks:

- Ethereum mainnet
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Base
- Polygon
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- Avalanche (USDC only)

By default, ZeroDev spends USDC and USDT interchangeably, which means that if you have say 100 USDC on Arbitrum, you can spend 100 USDC or USDT (or any mix thereof) on any other chain.

### Testnet

We support **USDC and ETH** on the following testnets:

- Ethereum Sepolia
- Base Sepolia

Note that we highly recommend testing on mainnets instead of testnets, due to the unreliability of bridges on testnets.
