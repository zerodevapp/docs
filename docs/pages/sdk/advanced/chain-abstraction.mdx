# Chain abstraction

:::info
This feature is in public beta and undergoing audit.  Please [contact us](https://t.me/derek_chiang) if you plan on going live with it.

ZeroDev is the first smart account solution to support *cross-chain transactions,* also sometimes known as "chain abstraction."

More specifically, a ZeroDev smart account can use its tokens from one chain on another chain, without bridging.  Some examples are:

- Stake ETH on Ethereum mainnet using ETH on Polygon.
- Spend USDC on Base to purchase an NFT sold in USDT on Arbitrum.
- Execute a transaction on Blast by paying gas in DAI from Optimism.

## Features

### Cross-chain without bridging

Don't ask your users to visit a bridge.  With ZeroDev, your users can make cross-chain transactions just like how they make normal transactions, without ever leaving your app.

### Unparalleled speed

Cross-chain transactions with ZeroDev are very fast, thanks to *intents* -- solvers compete on the destination chain to fill your intents as quickly as possible.

### Deep liquidity

Most "chain abstraction" solutions on the market are toys that fail under any real amount of traffic.  ZeroDev's cross-chain transactions network is built on top of protocols with the deepest liquidity, such as Across and Relay.

## Code example

Here is a [complete code example](https://github.com/zerodevapp/zerodev-examples/blob/main/intent/main.ts) for using CAB.  You can run the example by cloning the repo.

### Setting up the Kernel account

First, make sure you know how to [create ZeroDev accounts](/sdk/core-api/create-account).

The flow for creating a chain-abstracted ZeroDev account is the same, with the following exceptions:

- For your `kernelVersion`, make sure to use `KERNEL_V3_2` or above.

```ts
const kernelVersion = KERNEL_V3_2;
```

- When setting up the `kernelAccount`, set up the `initConfig` to install the intent executor:

```ts
import { installIntentExecutor, INTENT_V0_3 } from '@zerodev/intent'

const kernelAccount = await createKernelAccount(publicClient, {
  plugins: {
    sudo: ecdsaValidator,
  },
  kernelVersion,
  entryPoint,
  initConfig: [installIntentExecutor(INTENT_V0_3)]
})
```

- Instead of using the normal `createKernelAccountClient`, use `createIntentClient` instead:

```ts
const intentClient = createIntentClient({
  chain,
  account: kernelAccount,
  bundlerTransport: http(bundlerRpc),
})
```

## Using chain abstraction

At the core of chain abstraction is the idea of a "chain-abstracted balance" (CAB), which is a unified balance across all the chains.  For example, if you have 100 USDC on Base and 200 on Arbitrum, then you have 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" which you can spend on any chain.

### Getting Chain-abstracted Balances

To get your account's chain abstracted balances, use `getCAB`:


```ts
const cab = await intentClient.getCAB({
  // Specify any networks you want to aggregate.
  // If you skip this flag, it will aggregate from all the networks we support, but it may be slower.
  networks: [arbitrum.id, base.id],

  // Specify the tokens you want to aggregate balances for.
  // If you skip this flag, it will return all the tokens we support, but it may be slower.
  tokenTickers: ["USDC", "WETH"],
})
```

This will return not just the unified balance, but also the breakdown of the balance across chains, so that you know on which chains you actually have the tokens.

### Spending chain-abstracted balance

To spend your CAB on a transaction, use `sendUserIntent`:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  // You can batch any number of calls here
  calls: [
    {
      // USDC on base
      to: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913',
      value: BigInt(0),
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [account.address, parseUnits('1', 6)],
      }),
    },
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: base.id,
      address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on base
      amount: parseUnits('1', 6), // 1 USDC
    },
  ],
})
```

Here:

- `calls` is a [batch](/sdk/core-api/batch-transactions) of calls to execute atomically.
- `outputTokens` is the chain-abstracted token that your calls require.  For example, if your calls are looking to spend 500 USDC to buy an NFT, then you'd specify 500 USDC with the `outputTokens`.

Note that in this example, it doesn't matter whether you actually have USDC on Base.  So long as you have enough USDC across all the chains, the transaction will execute.

### Specifying input tokens

By default, when you spend CAB, the SDK uses tokens from chains with the highest balance.  If you need more fine-grained control, you can manually specify the input tokens with `sendUserInput`, which makes the API look like this:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  calls: [
    // ...
  ],
  inputTokens: [
    // ...
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    // ...
  ],
})
```

Here's a real example for using USDC on Arbitrum to execute a transaction on Base:

```ts
const result = await intentClient.sendUserIntent({
  calls: [
    {
      // USDC on base
      to: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913',
      value: BigInt(0),
      data: encodeFunctionData({
        abi: erc20Abi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
        args: [account.address, parseUnits('1', 6)],
      }),
    },
  ],
  inputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: arbitrum.id,
      address: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on arb
    },
  ],
  outputTokens: [
    {
      chainId: base.id,
      address: '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913', // USDC on base
      amount: parseUnits('1', 6), // 1 USDC
    },
  ],
})
```

Note that you do NOT need to specify an amount for your `inputTokens`.  Your input token amount is estimated from your output token amount, plus gas (assuming you want to pay gas with the input tokens -- see below).

### Gas configurations

When using intents, you may use the `gasToken` flag to configure how to pay gas.

- By default (with no `gasToken` specified), gas is paid in CAB (input tokens) itself.
- If you specify `gasToken: 'NATIVE'`, the account will pay gas with the native token (e.g. ETH).
- If you specify `gasToken: 'SPONSORED'`, you will be [sponsoring gas](/sdk/core-api/sponsor-gas) for the account.
- If you specify `gasToken: '0x...'` where the string is a ERC20 token address, you will be paying gas with the specified ERC20 token.

## Supported tokens and networks

Feel free to reach out to us with the link on top of this page if you want to see more tokens or networks supported.

### Mainnet

In the beta testing phase, we support only **USDC, USDT, and ETH** for cross-chain transactions, on the following networks:

- Ethereum mainnet
- Arbitrum
- Optimism

- Polygon
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

We will support all popular tokens when we enter production.

### Testnet

We support **USDC and ETH** on the following testnets:
