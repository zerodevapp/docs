# ZeroDev Go SDK Documentation

## Overview

:::info
The Go SDK and UserOp Builder API is only available for users on the Enterprise plan.
:::

The [ZeroDev Go SDK](https://github.com/zerodevapp/go-sdk) works with the user operation builder API to help developers build and send User Operations (UserOps) on Ethereum and compatible networks using Go.

The user operation builder API is also accessible for self-hosting via Docker. Contact the ZeroDev team for more details.

The ZeroDev Go SDK enables developers to:

- Build and send EIP-7702 User Operations (UserOps)
- Sign EIP-7702 authorizations from private keys
- Batch multiple blockchain calls in a single User Operation
- Poll for User Operation receipts

## Installation

Install the SDK using Go modules:

```bash
go get github.com/zerodevapp/sdk-go
```
