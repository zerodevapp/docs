# ZeroDev Introduction

**ZeroDev is the most powerful smart account solution**, with support for both ERC-4337 and [EIP-7702](/sdk/getting-started/quickstart-7702).

ZeroDev improves Web3 UX by enabling:

- Key abstraction
    - Login with [passkeys](/sdk/advanced/passkeys) or [social accounts](/sdk/signers/intro).
    - [Recover user accounts](/sdk/advanced/recovery) if they lose their login.

- Gas abstraction
    - [Sponsor gas](/sdk/core-api/sponsor-gas) for users.
    - Let users [pay gas with ERC20 tokens](/sdk/core-api/pay-gas-with-erc20s).

- Transaction abstraction
    - [Batch multiple transactions](/sdk/core-api/batch-transactions) into one.  No more tedious approvals.
    - [Automate transactions](/sdk/permissions/intro) with session keys.  Great for AI agents.

- Chain abstraction
    - [Spend tokens on any chain](/sdk/advanced/chain-abstraction), without bridging.
    - [On/offramp with any exchanges](/global-address), even on L2s.

ZeroDev can be used as a standalone embedded smart account, or used alongside WaaS solutions such as Privy and Dynamic.

ZeroDev is the most trusted solution in AA, powering more than 6 million smart accounts on 50+ networks for 200+ teams.
