# Rate Limit Policy

The rate limit policy specifies the frequency at which the signer is allowed to send UserOps.

## API

```ts
import { toRateLimitPolicy } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

// In this example, the signer can send one UserOp per month
const rateLimitPolicy = toRateLimitPolicy({
  count: 1,
  interval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  // one month in seconds
})

const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    rateLimitPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

Arguments to `toRateLimitPolicy`:

- `count`: the number of times the signer can send UserOps in the given internal.
- (optional) `interval`: the length of the interval, in seconds.
  - If not specified, then the interval is infinite, which means that you can use `count` to specify the number of times the signer can send UserOps in total.
- (optional) `startAt`: the starting UNIX timestamp for when the rate limit should take effect.  Before that, the signer cannot send any UserOps.

## Using RateLimitPolicy with reset

### API

The Rate Limit Policy with reset allows you to define a recurring allowance of UserOps that refreshes after each interval period. This is useful for creating recurring permissions that automatically renew, such as monthly subscription payments or regular administrative actions.

Unlike the standard Rate Limit Policy which counts down a total number of allowed operations, the reset version gives the signer a fresh allocation of operations after each interval passes.


```ts
import { toRateLimitPolicy, RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT } from "@zerodev/permissions/policies"

// In this example, the signer can send one UserOp per month
const rateLimitPolicy = toRateLimitPolicy({
  count: 1,
  interval: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  // one month in seconds
})

// only difference from non-reset is using RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT for policyAddress
const validator = toPermissionValidator(publicClient, {
  policyAddress : RATE_LIMIT_POLICY_WITH_RESET_CONTRACT,
  entryPoint,
  kernelVersion,
  signer: someSigner,
  policies: [
    rateLimitPolicy,
    // ...other policies
  ],
})
```

### Comparison with Rate Limit Policy without reset

- With reset
  - userOps can be called up to `count` times within a given `interval`.
  - The amount of available userOps resets when the current `interval` expires (meaning you get `count` uses again).

- Without reset
  - userOps can be called a total of `count` times, and the available amount only decreases with use (no reset over time).
  - Each userOps call must have at least an `interval` of time between it and the next call.

#### example

if you want to set recurring payment logic for every month without reset and expect to live for next 2 years, parameters will be

```
  count : 24,
  interval : 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // 30 days for month
  startAt : <Current timestamp in UNIX timestamp format>
```

if you want to set it with reset, parameters will be

```
  count : 1,
  interval : 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 // 30 days for month
  startAt : 0 or undefined
```

### Notice

Although RateLimitWithReset is powerful, it violates erc4337 opcode rule to access `block.timestamp` this will only work with bundlers that accepts this opcode
