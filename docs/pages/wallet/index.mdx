# ZeroDev Wallet

ZeroDev Wallet is the first **smart embedded wallet** -- an embedded wallet optimized for smart accounts.

## Demo

Check out [this demo](https://zerodev-signer-demo.vercel.app/) for a self-custodial wallet powered by social logins and gas sponsorship.

## Why ZeroDev Wallet

### Smart by Default

Most embedded wallets use EOAs by default, and only support smart accounts as a secondary option.  On the other hand, ZeroDev Wallet uses smart accounts *by default* through EIP-7702 and ERC-4337.

As a result, smart account features such as gas sponsorship, transaction batching, transaction automation, and chain abstraction are available as native APIs with ZeroDev Wallet, while other embedded wallets typically only support a subset of these features.

### Get the best of on-chain & off-chain

ZeroDev Wallet combines the best of off-chain and on-chain tech: TEE (trusted execution environment) for off-chain key management, and smart accounts for on-chain account management.  This enables ZeroDev wallet to offer powerful wallet features that are difficult if not impossible with other solutions, including:

- A hybrid on-chain / off-chain policy engine
- Resource-lock chain abstraction 
- Fully counterfactual session keys

## ZeroDev Wallet vs ZeroDev SDK

[ZeroDev SDK](/) is a *smart account SDK* that can be used to create smart accounts from any key management system of your choice, including local private keys and other WaaS solutions such as Privy, Dynamic, and Turnkey.

On the other hand, ZeroDev Wallet is a complete embedded wallet solution that bundles key management with smart accounts.
