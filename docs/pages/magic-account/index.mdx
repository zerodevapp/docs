Magic Account is a **chain-abstracted smart account** that you can embed into your application, to enable a seamless onboarding and transaction experience for your users.

Through **account abstraction** and **chain abstraction**, Magic Account removes the major pain points with Web3 UX today, including:

- Bridges
- Gas
- Seed phrases
- Confirmations

## Magic Account's top features

### Chain abstraction, not bridges

Magic Account is the first *chain-abstracted smart account* -- a smart account that aggregates its tokens into a "chain-abstracted balance (CAB)" that's simultaneously available on every chain.

For example, if you deposit 100 USDC to a Magic Account account on Base, then deposit 200 USDC to the account on Polygon, the account will now hold 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" that can be spent on any chain.

Amazingly, these chain-abstracted tokens can be spent *at the speed of the destination chain* -- just like a regular transaction.  This is unlike a traditional bridge where the user has to wait for confirmations on both the source chain and the destination chain.

### Paymasters, not gas

With Magic Account, you can sponsor gas for users, or just let them pay gas with their tokens on another chain.  Don’t ever ask users to buy gas tokens for a new chain again.

### Passkeys and socials, not seed phrases

Make your app friendly for both Web3 natives and normies.  With Magic Account, your users can login with socials, passkeys, and EOAs.

### Permissions, not confirmations

Magic Account supports [ERC-7715 permissions](/magic-account/knowledge-base/permissions), an open-standard for automating transactions for users to enable 1-click trading and even server-side automation.  No more annoying confirmation prompts to distract your users.
