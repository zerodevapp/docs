# Basic Usage of Magic Account

Magic Account is the first smart account solution to make extensive use of open standards including [ERC-5792](/magic-account/knowledge-base/capabilities) (aka "capabilities") and [ERC-7715](/magic-account/knowledge-base/permissions) (aka "permissions").  As such, you can use Magic Account through standard libraries including Wagmi and Viem.

To start using Magic Account:

- If you had set up Magic Account as a Wagmi connector, you can use Magic Account through [standard Wagmi hooks](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks).

- If you had set up Magic Account as a Viem wallet client, you can use Magic Account through [standard Viem actions](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/introduction).

The standard Wagmi and Viem APIs will allow you to perform basic actions such as [sending transactions](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/send-transaction), [reading from contracts](https://wagmi.sh/react/guides/read-from-contract), etc.
